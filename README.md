### âœ§ãƒ»ï¾Ÿ:* Hi there *:ãƒ»ï¾Ÿâœ§ 

My name is AngÃ©lica, but you can call me Angel (Â´ãƒ»Ï‰ãƒ»ï½€). I'm from Brazil and I'm a mechatronics engineering student :wrench:. I've been studying front-end development since I discovered this huge universe of creating pretty and functional things :two_hearts:. I'm here to learn and share. I would like to produce a lot of content here and contribute to the open source community.
